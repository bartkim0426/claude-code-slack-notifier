2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

## Style Guide

### Shell Script Style

* Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang

* Use meaningful variable names in UPPER_CASE
* Add comments for complex logic
* Use functions for repeated code

### Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Documentation

* Use Markdown for all documentation

* Keep language clear and concise
* Update README.md if needed

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
./test.sh
```

Add new tests for any new functionality:

```bash
# tests/test_new_feature.sh
#!/bin/bash
source ./tests/test_helper.sh

test_my_new_feature() {
    # Your test here
    assert_equals "expected" "actual"
}

run_test test_my_new_feature
```

## Release Process

1. Update version in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md

4. After merge, tag the release
5. GitHub Actions will handle the rest
